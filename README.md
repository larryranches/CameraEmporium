# CameraEmporium

# Background

I decided to build a layered stack consisting of a Single Page Application front-end, Rest API and Sql database backend for my Computer Science 645 final project. Coming from a .NET C# Visual Studio background, one of my goals for this project was to try and mirror what I would've done in .NET. It would have probably consisted of a MSSQLServer Database, .NET Web API 2, and an Angular 1.3 front-end using Visual Studio as an IDE. I tried to also create a similar workflow which is different using Eclipse and Java. After doing research and completing this project, this is what I came up with.

This was completed in May 2015 by the way. I recently set this up locally with a mamp server and got it working again as of May 2016. Just wanted to share some of the projects I've done in the past, so now I'm posting this in my GitHub Repo.

# Tech Stack
- Angular 1.3
- Java
- Jersey Rest API Framework
- MYSQL

# Other Notes

- src folder contains the backend API code written in Java using Jersey Rest api framework
- WebContent folder has the Angular 1.3 front-end code.
